[LING297: Pragmatics] Course Information

Good Afternoon,

I am very excited about our special topics course in Pragmatics this upcoming semester. Ahead of our first class, in case you did not already have a copy, I wanted to pass along the class syllabus. We will discuss the course structure and topics in more details when we meet next Wednesday. If you have any pressing questions ahead of time, though, please feel free to email me ahead of time.

Finally, in my effort to attach the syllabus to this email, I accidentally attached a digital version of our course textbook (and despite multiple attempts could not figure out how to remove it). Hopefully you will have better luck that I in figuring how what to do with it.

I hope you are able to enjoy the beautiful weekend ahead and will see you all in class next week!

Best,
Taylor
